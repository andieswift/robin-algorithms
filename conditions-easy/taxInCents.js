// Hip hip hooray! It’s tax season! Your CPA has requested that you provide your tax amounts in cents this year.
// Rather than using pen and paper, wouldn’t it be faster for you to write a
// function that accepts a dollar amount and a tax percentage and returns the taxed amount in cents ?

function taxInCents(dollarAmount, taxPercent){
  return dollarAmount*taxPercent;
}
